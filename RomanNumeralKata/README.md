#### Goal
For this project we would like you to design a program to work with Roman numerals-addition of Roman numerals without converting to Arabic. 

#### Description
The Romans wrote their numbers using letters; specifically the letters "I, V, X, L, C, D, and M." There were certain rules that the numerals followed which should be observed.

The symbols 'I', 'X', 'C', and 'M' can be repeated at most 3 times in a row. 'V', 'L', and 'D' can never be repeated.
As arabic numbers can be split into their constituent parts (1066 becomes 1 0 6 6), so too can Roman numerals, just without the zero (1066 becomes MLXVI, or M (1000) LX (60) and VI (6)).
The symbols ('I', 'X', and 'C') can only be subtracted from the 2 next highest values ('IV' and 'IX', 'XL' and 'XC', 'CD' and 'CM'). The symbols ('V', 'L', and 'D') can never be subtracted.
Only one subtraction can be made per numeral ('XC' is allowed, 'XXC' is not).
